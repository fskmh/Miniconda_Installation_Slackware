- Note that the first two steps are only required if you previously installed Anaconda or Miniconda.
cd && rm -rf miniconda3
- If you previously installed Anaconda, make sure you remove the automatic initialisation in your .bashrc first.
- Hint: Remove everything between (and including) these lines:
# >>> conda initialize >>> and # <<< conda initialize <<<
- Now enter the following three commands at the terminal prompt:
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod a+x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
- Agree to licence
- Confirm installation location (default is fine).
- Miniconda unpacks
- Do not initialise Miniconda (this is currently the default, so just press enter at the prompt).
- Copy and paste the following lines in your home .bashrc file:
alias miniconda_init='eval "$(${HOME}/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"'
alias py39_init='eval "$(${HOME}/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)" && conda activate py39'
- If you are an Ubuntu or Debian user you should rather paste these lines into the .bash_alias file.
- Source your .bashrc ("source .bashrc") or close the terminal and open a new one.
- Type "alias" to see a list of aliases or just type "miniconda_init".
- Just press tab after the first 4 or so letters, you don't have to painstakingly type the whole thing.
- To install Python 3.9 in a Conda environment with the name py39 type the following:
conda create -n py39 python=3.9 anaconda
- Note that you can also install a minimal environment without specifying the anaconda repo like this:
conda create -n py39 python=3.9
- You can use the same command to install an environment for a different version of Python.
- To see what Conda environments are installed, use this command:
conda env list
- To see if a library is installed in the environment, e.g. numpy, use this command:
conda list numpy
- You should now be able to switch to this environment using this command:
conda activate py39
- You could also just use the "py39_init" alias to initialise Conda and activate this newly created environment in one shot.
- N.B. The conda prompt should change from "(base)" to "(py39)", otherwise something went wrong and you need to retrace your steps.
- If you type "python3" now, you should see the Anaconda, Inc. Python 3.9 prompt instead of the system Python prompt.
- Using this recipe you can have multiple Python environments running in different terminals without them interfering with each other.
- You can also still use Python packages provided by your distro simply by not initialising Anaconda/Miniconda.
- Note that if something goes wrong you can remove the environment from the Conda base env like this:
conda remove -n py39 --all
- Also note that if you have to pip install a package in the created environment you should first use this command to avoid some common installation errors:
pip install -U pip setuptools
