0. Note that the first two steps are only required if you previously installed Anaconda or Miniconda.
1. cd && rm -rf miniconda3
2. If a previous installation modified your .bashrc then remove everything between (and including)
# >>> conda initialize >>> and # <<< conda initialize <<<
in .bashrc in your home directory.
3. wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
4. sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
5. Agree to licence
6. Confirm installation location (default is fine).
7. Miniconda unpacks
8. Do not initialise Miniconda (this is currently the default, so just press enter at the prompt).
9. Copy and paste the following on its own line in your home .bashrc file.
alias miniconda_init='eval "$(${HOME}/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"'
10. Source your .bashrc ("source .bashrc") or close the terminal and open a new one.
11. Type "alias" to see a list of aliases or just type "miniconda_init".
12. Just press tab after the first 4 or so letters, you don't have to painstakingly type the whole thing.
13. To install Python 3.9 in a Conda environment with the name py39 type the following:
conda create --name py39 python=3.9 anaconda
14. You can use the same command to install an environment for a different version of Python.
15. To see what Conda environments are installed, use this command:
conda env list
16. To see if a library is installed in the environment, e.g. numpy, use this command:
conda list numpy
17. You should now be able to switch to this environment using this command:
conda activate py39
18. N.B. The conda prompt should change from "(base)" to "(py39)", otherwise something went wrong and you need to retrace your steps.
19. If you type "python3" now, you should see the Anaconda, Inc. Python 3.9 prompt instead of the system Python prompt.
