0. Note that the first two steps are only required if you previously installed Anaconda or Miniconda.
1. cd && rm -rf miniconda3
2. If a previous installation modified your .bashrc then remove everything between (and including)
# >>> conda initialize >>> and # <<< conda initialize <<<
in .bashrc in your home directory.
3. wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
4. sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
5. Agree to licence
6. Confirm installation location (default is fine).
7. Miniconda unpacks
8. Do not initialise Miniconda (just press enter at the prompt, default is no).
9. Copy and paste the following on its own line in your home .bashrc file.
alias miniconda_init='eval "$(${HOME}/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"'
10. Source your .bashrc or close the terminal and open a new one.
11. Type "alias" to see a list of aliases or just type "miniconda_init".
12. To install, for example, Python 3.9 in a Conda environment with the name py39 type the following:
conda create --name py39 python=3.9 anaconda
13. To see what Conda environments are installed, use the command "conda env list".
14. You should be able to switch to this environment using the command "activate py39" at the conda prompt.
15. The conda prompt should change from "(base)" to "(py39)".
16. If the conda prompt does not change from "(base)" to "(py39)" then try using "conda activate py39" instead of just "activate py39".
17. If you type "python" now, you should see the Anaconda, Inc. Python 3.9 prompt instead of the system Python prompt.
